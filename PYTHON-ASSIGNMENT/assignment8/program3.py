# You are tasked with creating a Python program that manages student 
# records using file handling. Your program should: 
 
# Create a file named students.txt and allow the user to enter student details 
# (Name, Age, Grade). Each student's information should be written on a new 
# line in the format: 
 
# ex Name,Age,Group 
# Alice,14,A 
# Bob,15,B 
# Charlie,14,C 


# def add_student(name, age, grade):
#     file=open(r"C:\Users\saiif\OneDrive\Desktop\Programming-concepts\Programming-concept\assignment8\students.txt", "rt"), "a") as file:
#     file.write(f"{name},{age},{grade}\n")


# def display_students():
#     with open("students.txt", "rt") as file:
#         print(file.read())


# add_student("Alice", 14, "A")
# add_student("Bob", 15, "B")
# add_student("Charlie", 14, "C")

# print("Student Records:")
# display_students()
