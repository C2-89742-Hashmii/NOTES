------------------------------- OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING -------------------



-> CLASS CAN BE CREATED BY [CLASS] KEY WORD

-> { __init__ ] method is a special method run only once when object is instantiated or created
   -> It helps in initializing object attributes
   -> It is similar to constructors in other languages like Java and C++
   -> If we donâ€™t define __init__, Python provides a default one that does nothing

-> Class--------->	  A blueprint for creating objects.
-> Object --------->	  An instance of a class with specific attributes and behaviors.
-> Encapsulation------->  Restricts direct access to data by using private/protected variables.
-> Abstraction--------->  Hides complex implementation details from the user.
-> Inheritance--------->  Allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
-> Polymorphism---------> Allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different implementations.
